           <h1 align="center">Academic Standing</h1>
           <p>Undergraduate academic performance is based on a student's grade point average (GPA). Students are required to maintain a 2.00 cumulative GPA to maintain satisfactory academic progress. Students with a GPA under 2.00 will be placed on Academic Probation. Students who fail to achieve a 2.00 cumulative GPA at the end of their probationary semester may be academically dismissed, depending on their credit level.</p>

<p>If you feel that you are struggling academically (even if your cumulative GPA is above a 2.00), you should see your academic advisor as soon as possible to discuss the issues that may be affecting your academic performance and to begin planning how to get back on track. <strong>It is your responsibility to know your academic status at all times.</strong></p>
