  <p> Students matriculating to the University of Maryland (including freshmen and students transferring from private institutions and from non-Maryland public institutions) beginning in Fall 2012 are subject to the University's new <a href="http://gened.umd.edu/">General Education program</a> requirements, except as provided below: </p>

  <p> The University of Maryland, College Park, requires students to complete a minimum of 40 credits of general education. Students transferring to the University who have completed their general education requirements at another Maryland public institution of higher education will be considered to have completed their general education requirements with the exception of an upper-level writing course and any additional credits necessary to complete the minimum number of general education credits. </p>
  <p> Students transferring to the University from another Maryland public institution of higher education who have not completed their general education requirements at another Maryland public institution of higher education will be treated as follows: </p>
  <ul> a. Students who matriculate to college beginning in Fall 2012 and thereafter will be subject to the new General Education program requirements upon transfer to the University of Maryland. </ul>
  <ul> b. Students who matriculate to college prior to Fall 2012 but transfer to the University of Maryland prior to Fall 2016 will be subject to the <a href="http://www.4yearplans.umd.edu/core4yearplans.html">CORE general education</a> requirements. </ul>
  <ul> c. Students who transfer to the University of Maryland beginning in Fall 2016 and thereafter will be subject to the new <a href="http://www.gened.umd.edu/for-students/forstudents-4yearplans.php">General Education program</a> requirements, regardless of the date of their matriculation at another Maryland public institution of higher education following award of the high school diploma. </ul>
  <p> Students returning or transferring to College Park after a separation from college of five or more continuous years must follow the requirements in effect at the time of re-entry. </p>
  <p>Students who matriculate to the University with a bachelor's degree from any regionally accredited college or university will be considered to have satisfied the University's general education requirements, regardless of when the degree was received.</p>
  <p>*For purposes of this transfer policy, matriculation means to be admitted to college and enrolled in classes following award of the high school diploma.</p>
