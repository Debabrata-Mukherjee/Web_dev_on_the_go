  <h3>Good Standing Overview</h3>
  <div>
    <p>If you left the University with a 2.0 GPA or above and one or more semesters have passed since you last registered for courses, you must apply and be approved for readmission before returning.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Check your registration blocks</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Please visit your <a href="http://www.registrar.umd.edu/current/">student account</a> to determine if you have any registration blocks. Your application cannot move forward in the review process if you have a judicial or financial block. Contact the <a href="http://www.oit.umd.edu/password/">Division of Information Technology</a> if your password has expired.</p>

		<h2> Judicial Blocks </h2>
		<p>If you have a judicial ineligibility block, or if you answered yes to a question in the Character and Conduct section on the reenrollment application, please visit <a href="http://osc.umd.edu/OSC/ProspectiveStudents.aspx">the Office of Student Conduct website</a> for instructions on obtaining judicial clearance. It is the student&rsquo;s responsibility to initiate this  process by completing the Social Clearance form found on the Office of Student Conduct website. Students must attach the  necessary documentation for both past disciplinary and past criminal history,  as outlined in the Social Clearance form. </p>

		<h2> Financial Blocks </h2>
		<p>If you have a financial ineligibility block, please contact the <a href="https://bursar.umd.edu/">Office of the Bursar</a> to obtain a financial clearance slip. Please submit the original clearance slip from the Office of the Bursar to the following address: 0110 Hornbake Library South, College Park, MD 20742.</p>

  <h3>Choose a Major</h3>
  <div>
    <p>All degree-seeking students at the University of Maryland are expected to make progress toward earning their degrees. The <a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/academicsuccess.html">Student Academic Success-Degree Completion Policy</a> establishes a structured framework and criteria to guide all students to completion of an undergraduate degree within a reasonable period of time. If a reinstated student is not making progress set forth in the policy or has violated the repeat policy, he or she may be required to select a new major before being approved for reinstatement.</p>
		<h2> Returning to Your Previous Major </h2>
		<p>The Student Success Office will contact the college offering your desired major to determine your eligibility to return to the major. You may receive notice that you must change your major if you have not met <a href = "http://www.4yearplans.umd.edu/">benchmarks</a> or <a href="http://www.lep.umd.edu/">LEP gateways</a> or you have violated the <a href="https://catalogundergraduate.umd.edu/files/2017-2018-UGCatalog.pdf">repeat policy</a>. These students will not be reenrolled until they have met with an academic advisor from a different major and developed a new graduation/four-year plan.</p>

		<h2> Changing Your Major </h2>
		<p>If you need to complete a major change please be aware that this can take several weeks to process; this does not need to be done before you apply, but you may want to start the process as soon as possible. As each major has unique requirements (typically outlined on the department's website) we suggest you start this process early so we can review your application in a timely manner. Please note that approval to change your major does NOT guarantee your ability to return to the University.</p>
		<h3>Limited Enrollment Programs</h3>
		<p class="belowh3">If you want to change your major to one of the following programs, the Student Success Office will contact the LEP Admissions office to verify your eligibility.
