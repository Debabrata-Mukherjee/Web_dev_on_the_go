    <h3>Academic Dismissal Overview</h3>
    <div class="card-block">
      <p>If you were academically dismissed from the University, you must apply and be approved for reinstatement before returning. You must submit a completed reinstatement application, including the required essays, transcripts from coursework taken elsewhere since dismissal, and any optional supplemental information that will be helpful to the your application, before the application deadline.</p>

      <p>You should also carefully consider whether you are ready to return to the University prior to applying for reinstatement. The Faculty Petition Board often requires students to enroll elsewhere and earn a minimum GPA/credit level before applying again. Many times the board believes it is in the student’s best interest to pursue a degree elsewhere.</p>

      <p>If you are reinstated, you must earn a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 by the end of your first semester of reinstatement or you will be academically dismissed again. Visit the <a href = "https://catalogundergraduate.umd.edu/files/2017-2018-UGCatalog.pdf" target="blank"> Undergraduate Catalog </a> for additional information about the Academic Probation and Dismissal policy.</p>

    <h3>Registration Blocks</h3>
    <div class="card-block">
      <p>Please visit your <a href="http://www.registrar.umd.edu/current/">student account</a> to determine if you have any registration blocks. Your application cannot move forward in the review process if you have a judicial or financial block. Contact the <a href="http://www.oit.umd.edu/password/">Division of Information Technology</a> if your password has expired.</p>

      <h2> Judicial Blocks </h2>
      <p>If you have a judicial ineligibility block, or if you answered yes to a question in the Character and Conduct section on the reenrollment application, please visit <a href="http://osc.umd.edu/OSC/ProspectiveStudents.aspx">the Office of Student Conduct website</a> for instructions on obtaining judicial clearance. It is the student's responsibility to initiate this process by completing the Social Clearance form found on the Office of Student Conduct website. Students must attach the necessary documentation for both past disciplinary and past criminal history, as outlined in the Social Clearance form.</p>
      <h2> Financial Blocks </h2>
      <p>If you have a financial ineligibility block, please contact the <a href="https://bursar.umd.edu/">Office of the Bursar</a> to obtain a financial clearance slip. Please submit the original clearance slip from the Office of the Bursar to the following address: 0110 Hornbake Library South, College Park, MD 20742.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Registration Blocks</h3>
    <div class="card-block">
      <p>The Faculty Petition Board reviews the number of credits you must earn to raise your GPA to a 2.00. If you have not demonstrated the ability to earn the required number of credits with a high enough GPA, you may want to consider taking courses at another institution before applying for reinstatement.</p>
      <p>If you have below a 2.00 GPA, please use the GPA calculator below to determine how many credits you must earn to raise your GPA.</p>

    <h3>Choose a Major</h3>
    <div class="card-block">
      <p>All degree-seeking students at the University of Maryland are expected to make progress toward earning their degrees. The <a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/academicsuccess.html">Student Academic Success-Degree Completion Policy</a> establishes a structured framework and criteria to guide all students to completion of an undergraduate degree within a reasonable period of time. If a reinstated student is not making progress set forth in the policy or has violated the repeat policy, he or she may be required to select a new major before being approved for reinstatement.</p>
      <h2> Returning to Your Previous Major </h2>
      <p>The Student Success Office will contact the college offering your desired major to determine your eligibility to return to the major. You may receive notice that you must change your major if you have not met <a href = "http://www.4yearplans.umd.edu/">benchmarks</a> or <a href="http://www.lep.umd.edu/">LEP gateway courses</a> or you have violated the <a href="https://catalogundergraduate.umd.edu/files/2017-2018-UGCatalog.pdf">repeat policy</a>. These students will not be reenrolled until they have met with an academic advisor from a different major and developed a new graduation/four-year plan.</p>

      <h2> Changing Your Major </h2>
      <p>If you need to complete a major change please be aware that this can take several weeks to process; this does not need to be done before you apply, but you may want to start the process as soon as possible. As each major has unique requirements (typically outlined on the department's website) we suggest you start this process early so we can review your application in a timely manner.  Please note that approval to change your major does NOT guarantee your ability to return to the University.</p>

      <h3>Limited Enrollment Programs</h3>
      <p class="belowh3">If you want to change your major to one of the following programs, the Student Success Office will contact the LEP Admissions office to verify your eligibility. Please note that you will need to meet the <a href="http://www.lep.umd.edu/">LEP requirements</a> and <strong> may</strong> be required to complete a separate application.</p>

        <li>- Be patient for a response</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Written Statement Checklist</h3>
      <p class="belowh3">We recommend using the following checklist when writing or reviewing your written statement.<p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>My statement reflects that I have carefully considered whether or not I am ready to return.</h3>
            <p>Both academic dismissal and withdrawal are usually the consequence of ongoing academic and/or personal issues.   Many students need time to improve the situations that led to these difficulties.  This especially applies to fall dismissals because of the short period between fall and spring semesters.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>My statement is honest and realistic.</h3>
            <p >Demonstrate that you are sincere in both your analysis of your difficulties and your desire to return. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>My statement shows that I take responsibility for my role in my dismissal or withdrawal.</h3>
            <p >There are many reasons that lead to dismissal or the decision to withdraw.  While your situation may be unique and complex, the Faculty Petition Board has read a wide range of explanations and appreciates a direct statement that shows maturity and humility.  If you are not in good academic standing, it is important that you explain why and outline how you will become a more successful student.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>My statement is an appropriate length. </h3>
            <p >Provide enough information to answer the questions, but don’t be long-winded.  The best written statements are concise and get to the point.  Each question is answered in at least a paragraph or two, but not longer than one page.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Where necessary, my statement has specific details.</h3>
            <p >For example, if you were dismissed because you did not put enough effort into your classes, it is not sufficient to write, “I’ll try harder and study more.”  Provide details about what steps you have taken or intend to take to remedy the situation that led to your dismissal.  If you withdrew for personal reasons, please be brief in describing your situation and why you believe you are now in a better position to return to your education. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>My statement shows that I am familiar with the dismissal/withdrawal policies of the University of Maryland and that I understand I am asking for an exception to University policy.</h3>
            <p >Read available information on <a href="https://catalogundergraduate.umd.edu/files/2017-2018-UGCatalog.pdf">dismissal</a> or <a href="http://www.testudo.umd.edu/soc/absence.html/"> withdrawal</a>. Dismissal students should use the GPA calculator to determine what semester grades are necessary to raise their cumulative GPA to at least a 2.00.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>My statement does not make assumptions or demands.</h3>
            <p >Do not assume that you will be reinstated because you have been in the past, or because you believe you provided a good enough reason for your difficulties.  We understand that you are eager to get a response, but please try to be patient.  You should anticipate that the Faculty Petition Board reviews many applications and it takes time to make an appropriate decision.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>I did not copy and paste a previous written statement.</h3>
            <p >The best statements demonstrate progress and are specific to your situation at the time of writing.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>My statement has been proofread.</h3>
            <p>Be careful to avoid spelling, punctuation, or grammatical errors.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
