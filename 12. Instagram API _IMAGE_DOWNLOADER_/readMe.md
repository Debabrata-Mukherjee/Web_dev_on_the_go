#About the project

####This is a simple website source code which will help you download your recent Instagram Imgaes to a local file on your computer with one **click of a mouse**.

For the sake of simplicity, I'm just downloading the recent 5 pictures. We can easily modify a single parameter to download all the images.

The code is written in PHP and uses Instagram APIs. The APIs are mostly used to authenticate a user, get the acess token and pulling out the images.

#Steps required to deploy this project

1. You will need a Instagram Account. Log into https://www.instagram.com/developer/
2. On the top menu find Manage Clients. Click on Manage CLients and Register for a new client.
3. Read the instructions and provide a legitimate *Redirect URI*. The URI should start with "http://" or "https://". URI's like "localhost/", "C://Users" wont work.
4. Clone the repository and use your own CLient_ID and Client_Secret to run the code.
5. Make a folder named InstaPics in your working directory(the folder where the program sits.)

While writing this web application, I referred to various youtube tutorials on Web API and REST tutorials. However, the biggest surce of help was Instagram Developer page documentation. All the tutorials are very old and Instagram has made a lot of changes in their API usage policies since then.

There are many things which have changed, for example, we need to have *autorization_token* for making any call to the API now.

Thanks for reading!
